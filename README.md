# runningLog
* Once quarintine started, I started getting into running
* Started off with the Strava App, however, I wanted an quick and easy way to log all of my runs 
* Also wanted a comments/notes section to jot down my thoughts during that run. 
* For example, there were many times where I realized that my form was off and wanted to jot down my mistake
* Went from Strava to the notes app for this reason, but wanted a more robust option
* Hence - __runninglog (tentative name, trying to think of cool names at the moment)__ 
* Vision is to create something clean and simple - one tab to see past runs and all of its meta info, and another to log the current run



TODO
* Add Firebase Auth and Read/Write to save user data to cloud.
